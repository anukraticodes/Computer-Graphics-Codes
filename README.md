### LAB 2 2D Transformations in C Graphics

A C program implementing 2D geometric transformations (Translation, Scaling, Rotation, Reflection, Shearing) on triangular objects using graphics.h library.

Interactive menu-driven application with color-coded visual output for computer graphics Lab2 assignment.

### LAB 3 3D Transformations in Cpp Graphics

A Cpp program implementing 3D geometric transformations (Translation, Scaling, Rotation, Reflection, Shearing) on 4xN dimensional objects using graphics.h library.

Interactive menu-driven application with color-coded visual output for computer graphics Lab3 assignment.

### LAB 4 Projection in Cpp Graphics

A Cpp program implementing 3D to 2D Projection techniques (Orthogonal and Perspective Projection) on 4xN dimensional objects using graphics.h library.

Interactive menu-driven application with color-coded visual output to demonstrate the difference between accurate engineering-style projection (Orthogonal) and realistic human-eye projection (Perspective) for Computer Graphics Lab4 assignment.
