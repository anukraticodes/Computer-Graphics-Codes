### LAB 2 2D Transformations in C Graphics

A C program implementing 2D geometric transformations (Translation, Scaling, Rotation, Reflection, Shearing) on triangular objects using graphics.h library.

Interactive menu-driven application with color-coded visual output for computer graphics Lab2 assignment.

### LAB 3 3D Transformations in Cpp Graphics

A Cpp program implementing 3D geometric transformations (Translation, Scaling, Rotation, Reflection, Shearing) on 4xN dimensional objects using graphics.h library.

Interactive menu-driven application with color-coded visual output for computer graphics Lab3 assignment.

### LAB 4 Projection in Cpp Graphics

A Cpp program implementing 3D to 2D Projection techniques (Orthogonal and Perspective Projection) on 4xN dimensional objects using graphics.h library.

Interactive menu-driven application with color-coded visual output to demonstrate the difference between accurate engineering-style projection (Orthogonal) and realistic human-eye projection (Perspective) for Computer Graphics Lab4 assignment.

### LAB 5 Line Drawing in C++ Graphics

A C++ program implementing line generation techniques using the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Algorithm and the Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm to draw lines between two user-defined points with the graphics.h library.

An interactive menu-driven application with color-coded visual output to demonstrate the difference between:
1) DDA Line Drawing → simple incremental floating-point method.
2) Bresenham’s Line Drawing → efficient integer-based method producing smoother results.

### LAB 6 Circle Drawing in C++ Graphics

A C++ program implementing **circle generation techniques** using the **Midpoint Circle Drawing Algorithm** and the **Bresenham’s Circle Drawing Algorithm** to draw circles with a user-defined center and radius using the `graphics.h` library.

1. **Midpoint Circle Drawing Algorithm**  
   - Uses a decision parameter to choose the next pixel location.  
   - Exploits **8-way symmetry** for efficiency.  

2. **Bresenham’s Circle Drawing Algorithm**  
   - Optimized integer-only method.  
   - Produces the same circle with fewer computations.  
   - Faster and avoids floating-point operations.

### LAB 7 Polygon Fill Techniques
- **a) Scanline Fill Algorithm**
- **b) Flood Fill Algorithm**
  - 4-connected
  - 8-connected
- **c) Boundary Fill Algorithm**

This lab illustrates the difference between **structured (scanline)** vs **region-based (flood/boundary)** filling techniques in computer graphics.

### EXTRA LAB 1: Virtual 3D Environment Creation in C++

A C++ program to create a virtual 3D environment using OpenGL, GLFW, GLAD, and GLM.  
The environment demonstrates core computer graphics concepts with:  
1) **3D Objects** → Geometries like room, cityscape, or natural landscape.  
2) **Lighting & Shading** → Ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting for realism.  
3) **Camera Controls** → Navigation, rotation, and zoom to explore the scene.  

Interactive program showcasing realistic object rendering, textures, and user-controlled camera movement.

### EXTRA LAB 2: Virtual Environment with Visual Actors in C++

A C++ program enhancing a virtual 3D environment by adding visual actors (objects, characters, or props) using OpenGL.  
The lab focuses on:  
1) **Actor Representation** → 3D geometry, textures, and materials.  
2) **Placement & Organization** → Logical positioning and spacing within the scene.  
3) **Scene Interaction** → Camera navigation to explore actor arrangement.  

Interactive simulation demonstrating spatial organization, realistic lighting, and actor rendering.
